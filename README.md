# Dog Breed Classification

This project involves training a deep learning model to classify dog breeds from images. The project includes scripts to train the model and a Streamlit web application to make predictions using the trained model.

## Project Overview

1. `train_model.py`: This script trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog breeds.
2. `app.py`: This script provides a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload an image of a dog and get breed predictions.

## Requirements

- `tensorflow==2.12.0`
- `streamlit==1.10.0`
- `Pillow==9.1.0`
- `joblib==1.2.0`
- `matplotlib==3.5.2`
- `pandas==1.4.2`
- `numpy==1.22.4`
