# Dog Breed Classification

This project involves training a deep learning model to classify dog breeds from images. The project includes scripts to train the model and a Streamlit web application to make predictions using the trained model.

## Project Overview

1. `train_model.py`: This script trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog breeds.
2. `app.py`: This script provides a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload an image of a dog and get breed predictions.

## Requirements

- `tensorflow==2.15.0`
- `streamlit==1.37.0`
- `pillow==10.4.0`
- `joblib==1.3.2`
- `matplotlib==3.7.2`
- `pandas==2.0.3`
- `numpy==1.24.2`
